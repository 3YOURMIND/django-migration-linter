=======================

Detect backward incompatible migrations for your django project. It will save you time by making sure migrations will not break anything.

Installation
------------

``pip install django-migration-linter``


Usage
-----


Add the migration linter your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "django_migration_linter",
        ...,
    ]


``python manage.py lintmigrations [GIT_COMMIT_ID] [--ignore-name-contains=IGNORE_NAME_CONTAINS] [--include-apps INCLUDE_APPS [INCLUDE_APPS ...] | --exclude-apps EXCLUDE_APPS [EXCLUDE_APPS ...]]``

================================================== ===========================================================================================================================
                   Parameter                                                                            Description
================================================== ===========================================================================================================================
``DJANGO_PROJECT_FOLDER``                          An absolute or relative path to the django project.
``GIT_COMMIT_ID``                                  If specified, only migrations since this commit will be taken into account. If not specified, all migrations will be linted.
``--ignore-name-contains IGNORE_NAME_CONTAINS``    Ignore migrations containing this name.
``--ignore-name IGNORE_NAME [IGNORE_NAME ...]``    Ignore migrations with exactly one of these names.
``--include-apps INCLUDE_APPS [INCLUDE_APPS ...]`` Check only migrations that are in the specified django apps.
``--exclude-apps EXCLUDE_APPS [EXCLUDE_APPS ...]`` Ignore migrations that are in the specified django apps.
``--verbose or -v``                                Print more information during execution.
``--database DATABASE``                            Specify the database for which to generate the SQL. Defaults to *default*.
``--cache-path PATH``                              specify a directory that should be used to store cache-files in.
``--no-cache``                                     Don't use a cache.

Examples
--------

3YOURMIND is running the linter on every build getting pushed through CI.
That enables to be sure that the migrations will allow A/B testing, Blue/Green deployment and they won't break your development environment.
As every reasonable tool, a non-zero error code means that at least one invalid migration has been found.

Backward incompatible migrations
--------------------------------

The linter analyses your migrations and checks the SQL for:

- Added ``NOT NULL`` columns, which don't have a DEFAULT value
- Dropping columns
- Renaming columns
- Renaming tables
- Altering columns (which can be backward compatible and potentially ignored)

Those are the most important and frequent backward incompatible migrations.
We are happy to add more if you can specify them to us.

Ignoring migrations
-------------------

You can also ignore migrations by adding this to your migrations:

.. code-block::

    import django_migration_linter as linter
    # ...

        operations = [
            linter.IgnoreMigration(),
            # ...
        ]
    # ...

.. code-block::

    The SQL generated by this looks like:
    --
    -- The Django migration linter will ignore this migration
    --
    select 1; -- dml ignores this migration;

Cache
-----
By default, the linter uses a cache to prevent linting the same migration multiple times.
The default location of the cache on Linux is
``/home/<username>/.cache/django-migration-linter/<version>/<ldjango-project>_<database_name>.pickle``.

Since the linter uses hashes of the file's content, modifying a migration file will re-run the linter on that migration.
If you want to run the linter without cache, use the flag ``--no-cache``.
If you want to invalidate the cache, delete the cache folder.
The cache folder can also be defined manually through the ``--cache-path`` option.

Tests
-----

The easiest way to run the tests is to invoke `tox`_.

You will need to install the test requirements, which can be found in the ``setup.py`` file.
A good way to get started is to install the development version of the linter by doing ``pip install -e .[test]``.

To be able to fully test the linter, you will need both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases running.
You can either tweak the ``tests/test_project/settings.py`` file to get your DB settings right, or to have databases and users corresponding to the default Travis users.
