# Usage

## Command line usage

The linter is installed as a Django app and is integrated through the Django management command system. 

`python manage.py lintmigrations [GIT_COMMIT_ID] ...`

Below the detailed command line options, which can all also be defined using a config file (`setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, `.django_migration_linter.cfg`):

## File configuration

Example `setup.cfg` file:

```
[django_migration_linter]
no_cache = True
exclude_apps = users
```

## Ignoring migrations

You can also ignore migrations by adding an `IgnoreMigration()` to your migration operations:
```
from django.db import migrations, models
import django_migration_linter as linter

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [...]
    operations = [
        linter.IgnoreMigration(),
        # ...
    ]
```

Or you can restrict the migrations that should be selected by a file containing there paths with the `--include-migrations-from` option.

## Ignoring migration tests

You can also ignore backward incompatible migration tests by adding this option during execution:

`python manage.py lintmigrations --exclude-migration-tests ALTER_COLUMN`

The migration test codes can be found in the [corresponding source code files](../django_migration_linter/sql_analyser/base.py).

## Production usage example

[3YOURMIND](https://www.3yourmind.com/) is running the linter on every build getting pushed through CI.
That enables to be sure that the migrations will allow A/B testing, Blue/Green deployment and they won't break your development environment.
A non-zero error code is returned to express that at least one invalid migration has been found.
